description: These days, many important steps are being taken all over the world to protect the environment. Even the country faced the tragedy regarding oxygen during Corona. Conservation of trees is necessary for oxygen to remain in the environment. Thatâ€™s why Maharajshree took a pledge to protect the environment and decided to build Bageshwar Bagicha across the country. Many Bageshwar gardens have also been constructed in many parts of the country including Madhya Pradesh.
